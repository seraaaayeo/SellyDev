#### We will use [object detection](https://github.com/JunHyeok96/object-dection), [image segmentation](https://github.com/JunHyeok96/Road-Segmentation), and depth images to make judgments to avoid objects.  
  
 
### 1. Receive image and point cloud from camera.

### 2. Use object detection, image segmentation, depth images to determine obstacles.

* #### Obstacle detection begins with the assumption that the portion of the segmentation that is not recognized as a sidewalk is an obstacle.

* #### However, considering errors in segmentation, it is more efficient to detect obstacles by object detection. Object detection was designated as the first priority.

* #### The y-value of the point cloud was used to limit the effective range of obstacles.

### 3. We need to know which direction these obstacles are located.

* #### Calculate the angle corresponding to each pixel with the x and z coordinates of the point cloud.

### 4. It is now time to distinguish the types of obstacles.

* #### Generally, for mobile devices, avoiding preparations should be made from a distance. 
* #### however,  For fixed things,  a closer distance can be accommodated.

* #### This part can be modified fluidly. 

### 5. Determine the path

* #### The number of pixels per angle was calculated for obstacles detected within 25 meters.
* #### And averaged the number of obstacle pixels between -10 and 10 degrees from each angle.
* #### The angle was selected by ordering the number of obstacle pixels low and close to 0 degrees.
* #### Among them, the angle with the least obstacles was selected.

#### The test environment is RTX2060 super (fps 15)
