## Description
교내 카페 '팬도로시'부터 AI센터까지 인도 보행으로 자율주행하는 배달로봇입니다.

This is an Autonomous-driving robot software which drives on pavement only. First test path is pavement in front of main gate, Sejong University along with road from 'cafe Pandorosi' to 'AI center'.

## Main Project List
* [Autonomous-driving](https://github.com/JunHyeok96/Autonomous-Driving-Vision) : Image analysis to aviod obstacle:pushpin:
* [road_segmentation](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/road_segmentation) : Segmentation for pavement driving
* [cartographer](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/cartographer) : 2D SLAM based on LIDAR sensor
* [openvslam](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/openvslam/VSLAM) : 3D SLAM based on Camera sensor
