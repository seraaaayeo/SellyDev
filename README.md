## Description
교내 카페 '팬도로시'부터 AI센터까지 인도 보행으로 자율주행하는 배달로봇입니다.

This is an Autonomous-driving robot software which drives on pavement only. First test path is pavement in front of main gate, Sejong University along with road from 'cafe Pandorosi' to 'AI center'.

## Our purpose
카메라 센서만을 사용한 vision 기반 자율주행 알고리즘 개발. 

This is an auto-driving algorithm based on vision.

## Main Project List
* [autonomous-driving-vision](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/selly/autonomous-driving-vision) : Image analysis to aviod obstacle:pushpin:
* [road-segmentation](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/selly/road-segmentation) : Segmentation for pavement driving
* [object-detection](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/selly/Obejct-Detection) : object detection to divide moving obstacle such as car and fixed object such as tree
* [VSLAM](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/selly/VSLAM) : Visual SLAM for mapping and localization to let robot know where it is
  * If you use Lidar sensor, you can use [cartographer](https://github.com/seraaaayeo/SellyDev/tree/cartographer) for SLAM
